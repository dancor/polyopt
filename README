- config processing almost working
- todo: make more general
  - support non-DEFAULT config sections in some way?
    (right now don't even error if these exist, and they are ignored..)
  - support subcommand options nicely?  (e.g. git clone .. vs git pull ..)
  - don't assume so much in the config processing in general?
  - allow changing of names of things that are autogenerated?
- todo: simplification?
  - now that we just have rigid types in Opts instead of supporting general
    conversion as well (couldn't get this to work, TH and
    ExistentialQuantification are hard..), maybe we can use even less TH or
    something
- todo: actually use this
  - use this in some programs and see what issues come up
